# Sonic-2-Nick-Arcade-Disassembly
A disassembly of the Nick Arcade prototype of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Genesis/Mega Drive; it was originally dumped in 2006 by drx on Hidden Palace after a community fund, and is quite unfinished, having many leftovers from Sonic 1 and only four of the levels, one of which was scrapped.
